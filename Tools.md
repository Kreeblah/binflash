# Boot Tools
1. Use Bootdump to dump a drive's bootcode
2. Use PrepBoot to convert the bootcode to data that can be used by bootflash. Some of the needed information can be found in the FirmwareID.xlsx file
3. Append the file generated by PrepBoot to the Bootflash executable (copy /b bootflash.exe+7203s.bin 7203s.exe)
4. Flash the bootcode using 7203s.exe
**Parts of bootflash and prepboot had to be modified to remove scrambling and http authentication routines. While unlikely this might have broken the tool and could potentially lead to damaged drives**

# FindBootkey
This tool will try to find the key to enter a drive's bootcode and the ID required for dumping by using brute force (values A000-Z999)

# versiondump
This tool retrieves information about firmware timestamps and write strategy versions from a drive

# idchange
Use this tool to change internal drive ID. **Should not be used and can only work on NEC - not on Optiarc drives. Make sure to have a full backup to revert to original value if needed**

# testdump
This program was used to try dumping data from the drive's flash memory. Multiple methods were used and had to be enabled on a case by case basis using #ifdefs
